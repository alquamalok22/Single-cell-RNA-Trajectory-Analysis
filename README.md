# Single-cell-RNA-Trajectory-Analysis
Single-Cell RNA Trajectory Analysis using Monocle 3:

Study Design:

Conceptualized and designed a single-cell RNA sequencing experiment to investigate dynamic changes in gene expression across different cellular states.
Experimental Execution:

Performed single-cell RNA sequencing on GSE132771 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132771)to generate high-dimensional gene expression profiles for individual cells.
Quality Control and Preprocessing:

Conducted rigorous quality control measures to filter out low-quality cells and genes.
Preprocessed raw sequencing data, including normalization, log transformation, and identification of highly variable genes.
Dimensionality Reduction:

Applied dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to capture the major sources of variability in the dataset.
Trajectory Inference with Monocle 3:

Utilized Monocle 3 for trajectory inference, reconstructing the developmental trajectory of cells and identifying branching points.
Cell State Annotation:

Annotated cellular states along the trajectory based on differential gene expression, identifying key markers for each state.
Visualization:

Generated visualizations, including trajectory plots, heatmaps, and t-SNE visualizations, to effectively communicate the temporal progression of cellular states.
Functional Enrichment Analysis:

Conducted functional enrichment analysis on genes associated with different cell states to gain insights into biological processes driving cellular transitions.
Validation and Interpretation:

Validated findings through cross-validation and comparison with existing literature.
Provided biological interpretations of observed trajectories and identified potential key regulators.
Communication of Results:

Effectively communicated results through written reports, presentations, and visualizations for both technical and non-technical audiences.
This outline provides a structured and detailed overview of your single-cell RNA trajectory analysis experience using Monocle 3.
